## Algorithms

### Algorithms is a finite set of instructions or logic, written in order to accomplish a certain predefined task. One of the best way to practice and learn a new stack is by solving algorithmic problems as it helps to increase oneâ€™s knowledge and strength in problem solving.

### Basic steps required to solve a problem:
- Define a high level description of the problem, the input and desired output
- Break down the solution with psedocode (a readable description of what an algorithm should do)
- Convert the pseudocode to a working implementation using a programming language of your choice (in this case, Ruby)
- After implementing the algorithm, try to refactor it so it can be improved
