## Linear search

Linear search is a very basic and simple search algorithm. In Linear search, we search an element or value in a given array by traversing the array from the starting, till the desired element or value is found.

It compares the element to be searched with all the elements present in the array and when the element is matched successfully, it returns the index of the element in the array, else it return -1. It is applied on unsorted or unordered lists, when there are fewer elements in a list.

### Pseudocode
1. Traverse the array using a loop
2. In every iteration, compare the target value with the current value of the array
3. If the values match, return the current index of the array
4. If the values do not match, move on to the next array element
5. If no match is found, return -1
