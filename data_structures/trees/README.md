## Trees
Trees are non-linear data structures, it doesn’t store data in a linear way. Data is organized in a hierarchical way. E.g. family tree, organizational chart, DOM (Document Object Model) - HTML tags, etc.

### Technical Definition of a Tree and its Terminology
A tree is a collection of entities called node connected by edges. Each node contains a value or data and it can also have a child node. The first node of the tree is called the root.
Tree nodes are all connected by links called edges. Links are used to manage relationship between nodes.
Leafs are the last nodes of a tree. They are the nodes without children.
Height of a tree is the length of the longest path (from the root) to a leaf.
Depth of a node is the length of the path to its root.

### Tree Traversals
This is also known as tree search, it’s the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once. Traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited.
